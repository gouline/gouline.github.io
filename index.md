# Hi, I'm Mike Gouline ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer and architect working in the data/ML field. Also the founder of [SYDspace](https://sydspace.org/){:target="_blank"} where I organise a few industry meetups, such as Sydney Kotlin User Group and Serversiders.

Are you looking for slides and/or sources for one of my tech talks? Click [talks]({{ '/talks' | relative_url }}).

My open source projectsâ€  and some past work apps ("portfolio") are listed under [work]({{ '/work' | relative_url }}).
