        <h2>CoinJar Touch</h2>
        <p>CoinJar is a simple everyday bitcoin payments app. My involvement  was 
        finishing the product after the initial framework and basic features were put 
        in place. As the sole Android developer on the project at the time, my 
        responsibilities included delivering the app on tight deadlines as well as 
        consulting on the appropriate UX practices.</p>

        <p>SafeMate is an app designed to help first responders with identifying the
        rescuee by scanning their NFC-enabled wristband and providing their medical records.
        The second version of the app that I delivered was a complete rewrite, which, in addition
        to containing new features, also introduced modern best practices and platform-recommended 
        tooling to the project.</p>
