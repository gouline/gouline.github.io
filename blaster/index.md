# Blaster

Simple tool for sending out Slack announcements to multiple users without creating a private channel (similar to blind carbon copy).

<a href="https://blaster.gouline.net" title="Blaster" target="_blank"><img class="hero" src="./hero.png" /></a>

Open-source web application written in Go and hosted on Heroku. Relies on the Slack API for all communication and persistence, 
but wraps it into a simple API of its own for optimisation.
