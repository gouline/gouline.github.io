    Safedome is the new way to keep your valuables and identity safe 24/7. Having 
    completed the iPhone app internally, Maxwell Forest engaged me to build the 
    Android app from scratch. In addition to the implementation, my duties included
    consulting on the better ways to convert the iOS design to Android best practices
    and building various internal web services.
