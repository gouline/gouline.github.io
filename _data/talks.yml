    Asynchronous Vert.x Applications in Kotlin
  description: >
    Looking at web development, Spring seems to be the star of most Kotlin articles and tutorials. 
    This talk will explore an asynchronous alternative that is Vert.x and evaluate its production 
    readiness. Weâ€™ll do that by writing a simple (but working) web API, with some neat Kotlin 
    features to boot, and figure out what the benefits of using this framework are.

    Kotlin production tales
  description: >
    Kotlin has finally graduated to a release version and we have rewritten one of our production 
    apps in the language. Now armed with some real-life perspective, the time has come to reveal 
    whether it was worthwhile or the conservatives who stuck with the "officially supported" Java 
    were right all along.

    Kotlin, the Swift of Android
  description: >
    Now that Apple released Swift for iOS, the need for a more modern language for Android 
    development has become even more apparent and although there are no official alternatives 
    available from Google, there is viable option from JetBrains -- Kotlin, a modern JVM-based 
    language fully integrated into Android Studio and easily usable with the Android SDK.
