  description: >
    Now that Apple released Swift for iOS, the need for a more modern language for Android 
    development has become even more apparent and although there are no official alternatives 
    available from Google, there is viable option from JetBrains -- Kotlin, a modern JVM-based 
    language fully integrated into Android Studio and easily usable with the Android SDK.

    It was only a matter of time before version 2.0 of the well-known dependency injection library 
    Dagger hit production and that marks a good time to discuss the changes in the new version and 
    how they can benefit Android developers.

    Kotlin has finally graduated to a release version and we have rewritten one of our production 
    apps in the language. Now armed with some real-life perspective, the time has come to reveal 
    whether it was worthwhile or the conservatives who stuck with the "officially supported" Java 
    were right all along.

  description: >
    Looking at web development, Spring seems to be the star of most Kotlin articles and tutorials. 
    This talk will explore an asynchronous alternative that is Vert.x and evaluate its production 
    readiness. We’ll do that by writing a simple (but working) web API, with some neat Kotlin 
    features to boot, and figure out what the benefits of using this framework are.

    Kotlin, a relatively new programming language running on the JVM, has been making 
    headlines as the more elegant alternative to Java in any of its applications. One of them 
    is Android development and this talk will explore the benefits that the 
    language offers for everyday coding.

  description: >
    Kotlin provides a mountain of features that Java developers previously never had access 
    to. This creates endless opportunities. This also creates confusion akin to that of a kid 
    in a candy store, which is exacerbated by the transition from simple beginner demos to 
    production code, expected to be readable, performant and maintainable. Which to choose? 
    Should I be doing this?

  anchor: data-science-and-other-buzzwords
  description: >
    Kotlin continues to conquer new areas of software development, but some are still firmly held by one or two languages. 
    Data science, statistical analysis and machine learning are largely Python domains, but with many performance-focused 
    implementations based on the JVM, Kotlin has a good chance to break into this scene too. The intention of this talk is 
    to give a shallow overview of what you can do today.
