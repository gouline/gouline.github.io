# Hello :)

My name is Mike and I'm a software engineer.

For a non-exhaustive list of my work, past and present, go to [Portfolio]({{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio).

If you're here because you watched one of my talks and need the materials, go to [Talks]({{ site.baseurl }}/talks).

For anything else, including contact details and other miscellanea, refer to my blog and social media accounts.
