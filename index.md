# Greetings!

My name is Mike and I'm a software engineer, founder of [Traversal Space](https://traversal.space/){:target="_blank"}, and organiser of [Sydney Kotlin UG](https://sydkotlin.space/){:target="_blank"}.

For a non-exhaustive list of my work, past and present, go to [Portfolio]({{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio).

If you're here because you watched one of my talks and need the materials, go to [Talks]({{ site.baseurl }}/talks).

For anything else, including contact details and other miscellanea, refer to my blog and social media accounts.
